                    <h3>Dear New College Student,</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your final months/weeks of high school wrapping up, you start to realize that your life is about to take a complete 180* turn into a whole new world and experience. You might be wondering what it will be like to live away from home, or to have nearly complete freedom from adult super-vision. You will undoubtedly be worried about the caliber of the courses in comparison to your High Schoolâ€™s. You may also be wondering what it is exactly that you will get involved with at your new college. I know that from personal experience I was overwhelmed and found myself lying in bed unable to sleep many a night because of all the daydreams that I was having of what I would become as a college man.</p>

                     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My advice to you is to slow down and to take it step by step, not letting all of the thoughts and dreams overwhelm you. However, I also believe that it is very important to live and breathe these day dreams of the legacy you want to make of yourself daily in order to keep yourself on the right track. It does not matter what you choose to do in your spare time here at the University. What does matter is the effort that you put into what you do and what you take out of the opportunities you choose. I challenge you to get highly involved somewhere on campus. When you see an opportunity, step out of your comfort zone, take on the responsibility and put your heart and soul into it so that when you look back, you only see success and that strong legacy you were dreaming of.</p>

                    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be thinking, well, I am not here for the extracurricular activities, I am here for the education. I understand exactly where you are coming from and hope that you keep the mindset that your education is your number one priority during your time at the University. However, college is not just about the education school-wise. It is also about the real life experience, connections and long time friends that you can make through Fraternities, Honor Societies and other organizations.</P>

                    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went into my Freshman year I had no intentions whatsoever of joining a Fraternity. I only knew of the stereotypes that you hear all over the news. I thought that Fraternities were simply irresponsible drinking clubs. However, my father, who was in a fraternity, talked to me about it and convinced me that there was much more to be found in fraternity life than what the media likes to believe. I decided to look around during rush and to check out the scene. I found a few houses that I liked and ended up coming back to them more than I had originally planned. At one house in particular, I met numerous guys that welcomed me and offered support in many ways. They offered to help familiarize me with campus, they offered to go to the library with me and to help me develop my studying habits, and they offered to do whatever they could to help my transition into college go as smoothly as possible. In this house I saw great potential and I also saw exactly how my personality and skillsets could help push that potential to success. I made the decision that if I were to join a house, it would be Delta Sigma Phi. </P>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I made this decision I ended up dwelling upon the original doubts that I had before rushing around. I once again was doubting my ability to excel in the Electrical Engineering program while getting involved with Delta Sigma Phi. I ended up deciding that I would give it a shot with the knowledge that I could always stop if it affected my education in a negative way. I lead my class of new members in GPA that first semester and found that indeed I did have the ability to succeed in more than just education.</p>

                    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining Delta Sigma Phi has been the greatest choice of my college career thus far. I have made numerous life-long friends and connections. One of my brothers was the corporate director of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and he got me very involved on his committee. Through this connection/opportunity I was able to communicate with companies such as Microsoft, Intel, General Electric and many more. Working with these companies through IEEE, I was able to make numerous connections and to find plenty of opportunities for summer internships/future job opportunities. I also have had the opportunity to volunteer 10+ hours each semester in order to give back to this community that has given me so much. Having the opportunity to take the position of service chair, I was able to really interact with organizations such as the American Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity.</P>

                    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that you should join a Fraternity, I am saying that I did and that it has been the experience of a lifetime. If I had to summarize this in just a few sentences, I would say this: Get involved somewhere on campus, put your heart and soul into the responsibilities that you take, and leave behind a legacy that you will be proud of.</P>

                    <p>Best Regards,</p>
